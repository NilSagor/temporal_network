# Research Question

The problem of data changing over time 


How to tackle Concept drift problem in large data-sets, which are represented by temporal networks or data that can be transformed. 



# Hypothesis

- remove the the systematic changes to the data over time such as trends and seasonality by differentiating
- abrupt change may be a specific observations in a range or the change in the distribution of one or more input variables.
- more attention on higher weight and less attention on low weighted data.
- choosing a particular parameterize of the selected model at every time step.
- identify possible change patterns
  


## Definition:
**Concept Drift:** the statistical properties of the target variable which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. (wikipedia)
Relationship between inputs and outputs variables in the underlying problem over time.


# related work
- probabilistic modeling to detect and predict the changes considering short-time memory.
- detect the moment of change between one concept (network pattern) to the other.
- measuring dissimilarity between one snapshot of the temporal network and the next one in time.
